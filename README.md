Phillips Hue + Leap Motion Integration hack

##Inspiration
Looking at the improvements in home automation , we were thinking about how we can take that a step further.
Initially, we looked at myo hardware which is an intense and grusome version of detecting hand movements. we quickly realized that this hardware was not quite suitable for our usecase as we needed to detect more simple and direct gestures. 

##Issues
There were numerous issues with the hardware. 
Firstly, the leap motion was quite inaccurate in getting the response.
Secondly, sending the response over to the Phillip Hue API took sometime which caused some unnecsary delay between the motion and the light displayed. 
Thirdly, we spent a big chunk of our time on setting up Phillp Hue. Setting up Leap motion was not too hard, but the phillip hue required an actual router to work with the WiFi in the E5 building at the University of Waterloo. 

##conclusion
This Hack was quite successful in the sense that it prototyped an innovate idea that has not been previously thought of. It was a clean and simple hack.
